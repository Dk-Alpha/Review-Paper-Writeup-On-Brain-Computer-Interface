# Review-Paper-Writeup-On-Brain-Computer-Interface
### Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are emerging technologies that allow direct communication between the brain and external devices.

> This review paper covers several articles that discuss the recent advances in non-invasive EEG-based BCIs for various applications, including communication and motor function restoration for patients with disabilities. The articles highlight the different modalities and technologies used in EEG-based BCIs, the challenges faced in developing reliable and effective systems, and the recent developments and potential future applications. The articles stress the need for standardized approaches in developing EEG-based BCI systems, standardized metrics for evaluating their performance, and artifact removal techniques. Despite the current challenges, the reviewed articles provide an optimistic outlook for the future of EEG-based BCIs, with potential applications in diverse fields such as gaming, virtual reality, biometric identification, and collaborative problem-solving.
